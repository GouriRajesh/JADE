# JADE

Jade is a one-stop shop for travel-related functions. It pulls together all of the apps that
one would use when visiting a new country under one roof. It helps to keep the app secure
since it eliminates the need to communicate information between numerous apps, and
all confidential data is hashed and saved in Google's database, which is not directly
accessible by the app.

Translate, Navigation, Documents, Payment, and Food are the five main functions that
may be performed with Jade. The translate function can be used to transform source text
to target text based on the user's preferences. The navigation feature can be used to
determine the best route between the source and destination sites. The document
function allows you to upload/store all of your key documents and then retrieve them as
needed. Wherever possible, the payment function is employed to complete digital
transactions. The food function can be used to locate nearby restaurants, see menu items,
and place meal orders.

All of these features are accessible from the app's home screen; but, in order to use them,
you must first register with Jade. If a user has an account, he or she can use the login
screen to access the app. If a user does not have an account, he or she must establish one
on the sign-up screen by giving basic information. We undertake authentication activities
and employ many functionalities such as the real-time database and cloud storage
through Google's Firebase, which has been incorporated into the app.

Overall, the app is simple to explore and use, with rapid access to all features and clear
instructions on how to utilise them.
